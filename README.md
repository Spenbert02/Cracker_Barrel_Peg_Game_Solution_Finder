# CrackerBarrelPegGameSolutionFinder
Simple python script that recursively finds a solution to any starting arrangement of the Cracker Barrel peg game.

CrackerBarrelSolutionFinder has no dependencies - just a simple python script.

Simply enter the inital empty peg position (sample board shows position indeces), and the program recursively tests every possible move
until a winning combination of moves is found.
